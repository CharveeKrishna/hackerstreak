Introduction - 
Technical skills are sets of abilities every person must and should develop to
thrive in the present technological era. This project mainly aids the students in
cracking the interviews in top-notch companies by helping them understand the
subject easily through visual simulations and by analysing their performance by
using ML algorithms.
Web-Scraping has been used in this project,where the courses are fetched
directly from the YouTube Data API V3. When in dilemma, Assistance is provided to 
the user using Chatbot which processes the queries using a natural language processing toolkit.

Conclusion -
I believe that this website will be a life saviour for many engineering
students.This project is not based on the thought of eliminating or challenging
the teachers but to ensure continuous comprehensive learning. This website will
